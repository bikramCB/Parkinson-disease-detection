# Parkinson-disease-detection
Self Project | Tool: Sklearn, Python

• Performed data pre-processing and analysis to get a decent understanding into the given dataset.

• Splitted into train & test datasets to forestall overfitting and precisely access the model.

• Executed data standardization to get proper meaning and ensures data quality.

• Trained Support Vector Machine model with trained data, evaluated the model by obtaining test data accuracy

0.88461 and train data accuracy 0.87179 & formed a predictive system to detect parkinson on input data.
